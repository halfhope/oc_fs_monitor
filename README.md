Does not require third-party libraries. Does not create copies of files.

## Features

The extension allows:

* track new, changed, deleted site files;
* configure extensions of scanned files (by default - executable files of systems based on the Linux kernel);
* add additional readable server directories for monitoring;
* exclude directories and files from monitoring by mask;
* view the contents of files with syntax highlighting, without the possibility of editing;
* run an automatic scan using the cron scheduler (wget/curl/cli), followed by an Email/WhatsApp/Telegram notifications to the administrator if there are changes;
* it is possible to add a nice widget to the main page of the administrative panel to view the last scan, as well as to manually start a new one.

## Compatibility

* OpenCart 1.5, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x versions.

## Dependencies

* For version 1.5, vqmod is used to add a widget to the main page.
* For versions 2.0 to 2.2 inclusive, ocmod is used to add a widget to the home page.

## Demo

Admin

* [https://fs-monitor.shtt.blog/admin/](https://fs-monitor.shtt.blog/admin/) (auto login)

## Installation

* Install the module through the standard extension installation section.
* Install module "FSMonitor" in the modules section. 
* Go to the module page. This step will start the initial scan.
* To display the widget, go to "Modules > Control Panel", select FSMonitor. Specify a width of 12 and a sort order of 0 in the settings. This will display the full-width module at the very top.
* For versions prior to 2.3, the widget is rendered using vqmod / ocmod.

## Management

* To enable automatic scanning with cron, go to the module settings section and copy one of the three code options to start scanning (wget/curl/cli). Paste this code in the scheduler, in the hosting control panel and run a task to check if it works.
* The module does not heavily load the server, so checks can be carried out several times a day.
* You can rename a scan on the preview page by clicking on the name of the scan.
